- Stage 3
  
  This is a stage created by me. I wanted to go back to this project and to practise in more advanced methods and implementations.
  In more depth I'd like to make performance improvements and some UI changes based on new Practises.
  The main purpose of this stage is to go from a basic OOP architecture to a more advanced and fuctional architecture. 
  This is MVP (Model View Presenter) architecture. Also I want to practise with reactive programming ( RxJava- RxAndroid ) and 
  to use Dagger 2.0 library. Finally add some testing functions in this project. Both UI ( Espresso ) and Unit testing.
